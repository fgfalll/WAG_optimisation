# Project Update - YYYY-MM-DD

## Major Enhancement: Configurable Production/Injection Profiles and Advanced Optimization Objectives

This update significantly enhances the realism and petroleum engineering relevance of the CO₂-EOR optimization by introducing user-configurable production/injection profiles and expanding optimization objectives beyond simple recovery factor.

### Key Changes:

1.  **New Data Models for Profiling and Operations:**
    *   **`core/data_models.OperationalParameters`**: Introduced to hold project-level operational settings like `project_lifetime_years`.
    *   **`core/data_models.ProfileParameters`**: A new dataclass allowing users to define the methodology for generating simplified annual production and injection profiles. Key settings include:
        *   `oil_profile_type`: "linear\_distribution", "plateau\_linear\_decline", or "custom\_fractions".
        *   `plateau_duration_fraction_of_life`: For the "plateau\_linear\_decline" oil profile.
        *   `oil_annual_fraction_of_total`: User-defined list of annual production fractions for "custom\_fractions".
        *   `injection_profile_type`: Currently "constant\_during\_phase".
        *   `warn_if_defaults_used`: A flag to remind users to customize profile settings.

2.  **Refined Economic and EOR Parameters:**
    *   `project_lifetime_years` moved from `EORParameters` to `OperationalParameters`.
    *   `EORParameters.WAG_ratio` clarified as a volumetric ratio (e.g., bbl water per MSCF CO₂).

3.  **Advanced Optimization Objectives:**
    *   The `OptimizationEngine` can now optimize for:
        *   `recovery_factor` (existing)
        *   `npv` (Net Present Value)
        *   `co2_utilization` (e.g., tonnes CO₂ injected per STB oil produced, minimized)
    *   The default objective is configurable via `config.json`.

4.  **Profile Generation Logic (`core/optimization_engine.py`):**
    *   **`_generate_oil_production_profile`**: Creates an annual oil production array based on the total recoverable oil (OOIP \* RF) and the selected `ProfileParameters.oil_profile_type`.
    *   **`_generate_injection_profiles`**: Creates annual CO₂ and water injection arrays. For WAG schemes, it considers `water_fraction` (from optimization variables) and `EORParameters.WAG_ratio` to distribute volumes.
    *   **`_calculate_annual_profiles`**: Orchestrates the generation of these annual profiles.

5.  **Enhanced NPV Calculation:**
    *   `_calculate_npv` now uses the generated annual production and injection profiles to perform a year-by-year discounted cash flow analysis.

6.  **Centralized Objective Evaluation:**
    *   A new method **`_objective_function_wrapper`** is now the core evaluation function for all optimization algorithms. It calculates RF, generates annual profiles, and then computes the chosen objective (RF, NPV, or CO₂ Utilization).

7.  **Configuration Updates (`config.json`):**
    *   New default sections added for `OperationalParametersDefaults` and `ProfileParametersDefaults`.
    *   `EORParametersDefaults` updated.
    *   `OptimizationEngineSettings` now includes `default_optimization_objective`.

8.  **User Warnings:**
    *   If default `ProfileParameters` are used, the system logs a prominent warning.

### Benefits of this Enhancement:

*   **Increased Realism:** User-defined proxy profiles allow for more nuanced economic evaluations.
*   **Petroleum Engineering Focus:** Optimization can now target key economic indicators like NPV and CO₂ efficiency.
*   **Greater Flexibility:** Users have more control over how project performance is modeled over time.
*   **Improved Decision Making:** Comparison of strategies based on more comprehensive objectives provides better insights.

### Simplifications and Limitations:

*   **Proxy Profiles:** The generated production and injection profiles are simplified proxies and **do not replace full dynamic reservoir simulation**. They are intended for high-level screening and optimization based on endpoint recovery factor models.
    *   Oil profiles (e.g., "plateau\_linear\_decline") are mathematical constructs scaled to match the total recovery factor; they do not inherently model complex reservoir dynamics like breakthrough or changing GOR/WOR.
    *   Injection profiles are currently limited (e.g., "constant\_during\_phase") and assume consistent rates during active injection periods for each phase.
*   **Recovery Factor Model Dependency:** The accuracy of all subsequent economic calculations heavily relies on the accuracy of the underlying `recovery_factor` model chosen (e.g., Koval, Hybrid). These models are themselves simplifications.
*   **Annual Time Steps:** Current profile generation and NPV calculations are based on annual time steps. Sub-annual granularity for cash flows is not yet supported by the profile generators.
*   **WAG Scheme Simplification:**
    *   The WAG injection profiling assumes the optimized `rate` parameter is for CO₂ injection during its cycle. Water injection rates are derived based on `water_fraction` and the overall `EORParameters.WAG_ratio`. More complex WAG strategies with independently optimized CO₂ and water rates per cycle are not directly modeled.
    *   Cycle-to-cycle dynamics within WAG (e.g., varying slug sizes over project life) are not captured by the current "constant\_during\_phase" injection profile.
*   **Water Production and Disposal:** Assumed that total water produced (and thus requiring disposal) is equal to the total water injected during WAG. Connate water production is not explicitly modeled.
*   **No Geomechanical Effects:** Pressure changes and their impact on caprock integrity, fault reactivation, or induced seismicity are not considered.
*   **Homogeneous MMP:** A single MMP value (potentially depth-averaged if `WellAnalysis` is used) is applied. Spatial variations in MMP due to fluid composition or temperature gradients across the reservoir are not captured by the core optimization loop's recovery factor calculation.
*   **Surface Facilities:** No explicit modeling of surface facility constraints (e.g., maximum liquid handling, gas processing capacity, CO₂ recycle loop efficiency). Injection rates are assumed achievable up to any defined maximums.
*   **Economic Parameter Stability:** Economic parameters (oil price, costs, discount rate) are assumed constant over the project lifetime for the NPV calculation. Price volatility or cost inflation are not currently modeled.
*   **Optimization Algorithm Behavior:** The performance and convergence of the optimization algorithms (GA, Bayesian) depend on the problem space's complexity and the chosen algorithm parameters. There's no guarantee of finding the global optimum.
