    - Robust `INCLUDE` processing with circular dependency detection.
    - NaN padding for incomplete property arrays (preserving raw data).
  - **Technical Insights**: State-machine parser significantly outperformed multi-regex. Memory mapping considered for very large files.

  - Base class for optimization methods.
  - Integration with recovery models as objective functions.
  - MMP calculation linkage.

- [x] âœ… **Hybrid GA-BO Optimizer - Core Implementation & Control (Iteratively Refined Q2-Q3 2025)**
  - **Genetic Algorithm (GA) Component**:
    - Dictionary-based individuals for parameter clarity and flexibility.
    - Parallel fitness evaluation (`ProcessPoolExecutor`).
    - Operators: Tournament selection with elitism, Blend crossover, Gaussian mutation.
  - **Bayesian Optimization (BO) Component**:
    - Support for `skopt` ('gp' method) and `bayes_opt` ('bayes' method) backends.
  - **Hybridization Logic (`hybrid_optimize` method)**:
    - Mechanism for transferring multiple elite solutions from GA's final population to BO.
  - **Configuration-Driven Control (Key Enhancement)**:
    - **The `hybrid_optimize` method is now primarily controlled by the `OptimizationEngineSettings.hybrid_optimizer` section in `config.json`.**
    - Allows distinct GA parameters for the hybrid's GA phase (`ga_params_hybrid` or default).
    - Configurable BO phase settings (iterations, random starts, method) for the hybrid context.
    - Configurable number of GA elites to transfer to BO (`num_ga_elites_to_bo`).
  - **Physics-Informed Objective Function**:
    - Utilizes various `RecoveryModel` implementations (Koval, Miscible, Immiscible, Hybrid).
    - `_get_ga_parameter_bounds` for dynamic definition of the GA search space based on `EORParameters` and MMP.
  - **Technical Insights**: Dictionary-based GA significantly more maintainable. Configurable hybrid strategy is crucial for systematic research and benchmarking.
  - **Challenges Overcome**: Ensuring robust parameter consistency between GA individuals, BO search spaces, and recovery model inputs. Designing a flexible and clear configuration hierarchy for the hybrid strategy.

- [x] âœ… **Recovery Models & Transition Physics (`core.py`)** (Largely Implemented, Ongoing Refinement)
  - **Implemented Models**: `Simple`, `Koval`, `Miscible`, `Immiscible`, and `HybridRecoveryModel`.
  - **`HybridRecoveryModel`**:
    - Integrates miscible/immiscible physics via a `TransitionEngine`.
    - `TransitionEngine` supports configurable functions (Sigmoid, Cubic) and parameters (alpha, beta, fit points).
  - **Parameterization**: Model `__init__` behavior primarily driven by `RecoveryModelKwargsDefaults` in `config.json`. Runtime parameters (e.g., `v_dp_coefficient`) passed during `calculate`.
  - **GPU Awareness**: `cupy` checks and conceptual GPU paths in `TransitionEngine`. Code primarily runs on CPU for core logic.

- [ ] ðŸ”„ **Visualization System (`core.py` plotting methods)** (Partially Implemented, Needs Expansion for Research Analysis)
  - **Implemented**: Basic MMP vs. depth profiles, conceptual optimization outcome/convergence plots, parameter sensitivity analysis plots.
  - **Pending for Enhanced Research Analysis**:
    - Detailed GA/BO convergence history plotting (best/average fitness per generation/iteration).
    - Comparative plots for benchmarking different optimizer configurations and strategies.
    - Visualization of parameter landscapes explored by the optimizers (if feasible, e.g., 2D slices).
  - **Performance**: Plotting is for analysis, not a performance bottleneck itself.
