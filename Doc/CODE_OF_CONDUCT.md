# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our research community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Academic level or seniority
- Research discipline
- Personal characteristics
- Professional background

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy academic environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other researchers
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the scientific community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment of any form
- Discriminatory remarks or jokes
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional research setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Research supervisors and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all research spaces (online and in-person), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the research project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [taras.petrenko@nupp.edu.ua]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
